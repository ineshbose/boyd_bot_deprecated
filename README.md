# Boyd Bot (Deprecated)
This repository is from [Heroku Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git), and was used to test and deploy the Flask version of Boyd Bot. <br />


In order to increase transparency, better practice and contributions, the deployment process has been changed to a [public repository](https://github.com/ineshbose/boyd_bot_messenger). This was planned from the beginning. Therefore, this repository is no longer in-use and archived, but is public in order to go through the [commits](https://github.com/ineshbose/boyd_bot_deprecated/commits) to see how the bot was developed. <br />


The first couple of commits might be embarrassing, but were experiments to get an idea of how it would work. The last version of this repository uses [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) (for web-scraping) and [Wit.ai](https://github.com/wit-ai/pywit) (for understanding). While the current/new version has the same idea (as of the date of this commit), it's a good idea to remember that the new repository is more efficient, secure and reliable. <br />
